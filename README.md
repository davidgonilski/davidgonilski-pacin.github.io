<br>
  I am Molecular Biologist PhD Student at the [Buenos Aires University (UBA)](https://www.uba.ar/internacionales/index.php?lang=en), Argentina working in the [Biomedicine Institute of Buenos Aires](http://ibioba-mpsp-conicet.gov.ar/index.php/en/). I am highly interested in understanding the genetic regulatory networks and molecular signal pathways that drive kidney cancer.

## <span style="color:  #63D4FD;"> Research</span>
The main aim of my study is to understand the mechanisms behind tumorigenesis and improve treatments in kidney cancer. I focus on the RSUME oncogene's involvement in the development of Von Hippel Lindau tumors. I analyze genomic and transcriptomic datasets and perform wet lab experiments to support my findings.
